## Project Overview

In this notebook, we build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline!

We begin by investigating the [LibriSpeech dataset](http://www.openslr.org/12/) that will be used to train and evaluate your models. Our algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. We will then move on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, we will investigate by creating and testing our own state-of-the-art models. Throughout the notebook, we read research papers for additional reading and go through links to GitHub repositories with interesting implementations.
